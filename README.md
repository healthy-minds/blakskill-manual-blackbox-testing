# Blakskill Manual Blackbox Testing

## Project Overview
This repository contains the **manual blackbox testing documentation** for the **Blakskill Web Application**, carried out as part of the **Testars Quarters Bootcamp**.  
It was a project involving **11 team members**, aimed at evaluating the applicationâ€™s core functionality, identifying defects, and providing actionable recommendations to improve product quality before next release.

## Scope of Testing
The testing covered:
- **User Registration**
- **Login**
- **Forgot Password**
- **Finding Job**
- **Finding Talent**

## Tools & Technologies
- **Documentation:** Google Docs, Google Sheets
- **Bug Tracking:** Google Sheets
- **Browsers Tested:** Google Chrome
- **Operating Systems:** macOS, Windows

## Project Deliverables
This project includes the following QA documents:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| PRD (Product Requirements Document) | Defines the scope, objectives, and functional requirements of the web application. |
| Test Plan | Outlines the testing strategy, objectives, resources, and schedule. |
| Test Cases | Step-by-step scenarios to validate the applicationâ€™s functionality. |
| Bug Report | List of identified defects with severity, priority, and reproduction steps. |
| Test Summary Report | Summary of the testing activities, coverage, and results. |

## Testing Approach
We applied **blackbox testing techniques** to verify functionality without access to source code. The approach included:
1. Reviewing requirements in the PRD.
2. Designing detailed test cases.
3. Executing tests on supported browsers and devices.
4. Logging defects.
5. Preparing a test summary report.

## Key Findings
- Critical issues identified in **job application flow**
- Several UI/UX inconsistencies logged for design improvements.
- Logout functionality worked as expected on all tested devices.
